"Rufus" - skybox by Avoc @ eft-clan.com

Instructions: 
1. Place the "rufus_sky" folder (containing the pictures) into your etmain/textures/ folder.
2. Place the "rufus_sky.shader" in your etmain/scripts/ folder.
3. In your shaderlist.txt add "rufus_sky" at the bottom.
4. You are ready to go! :)

Remember, I saved the different pictures with maximum quality. For that reason they are quite large in size.
They will add alot to your .pk3 if you do not resave the .jpg under a stronger compression. It is possible to cut the overall filesize down to around 1mb without 
any noticable quality hit.
