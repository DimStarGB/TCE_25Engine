# ET/ETLegacy Dynamic Lighting â€” Archived

This project is moving visuals to **DarkPlaces** (realtime lighting, shadows, HDR, post).
The following ET/ETLegacy dynlight artifacts are **legacy** and should not be used or built.

## Notes

- Code remains for historical reference until a full removal is approved.
- DarkPlaces usage: see `autoexec_dp.cfg` and `assets/scripts/dp_overrides.shader`.
